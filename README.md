Movie Guide Android app

The app uses the TMDb API to get movie and other details. It is written 
entirely in Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) 
architecture.

***Note:** In an effort to refactor this code to keep up with modern tooling, patterns and practices, a new repository [Telewise](https://github.com/Aayushjn/Telewise) has been created.*
